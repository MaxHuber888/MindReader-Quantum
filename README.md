## Introduction

Welcome to the MindReader Quantum Mobile App! Originally created for the 2023 MIT iQuHack hackathon, this application leverages quantum-computing technology to help users determine stages of dementia using MRI images. Built with Flask, Expo, React Native, and powered by a Python backend, this app utilizes a Hybrid Classification Model that employs Classical-to-Quantum transfer learning for improved accuracy.

## Features

- **MRI Image Upload**: Users can upload MRI images directly from their mobile devices.

- **Hybrid Model**: The app utilizes a Hybrid Model that combines classical machine learning with quantum computing techniques for improved image classification.

- **Stage Detection**: The app provides a clear and detailed report on the detected stage of dementia, including relevant medical information.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A user-friendly and intuitive interface ensures easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React Native: A popular framework for building mobile applications with a native look and feel.
  - Expo: A set of tools and services for building React Native apps more quickly and easily.

- **Backend**:
  - Flask: A lightweight web framework for building robust Python web applications.
  - Python: The programming language used to develop the backend logic and interact with the Hybrid Model.

- **Quantum Computing**:
  - PennyLane: An open-source quantum machine learning library used for quantum computing integration.
  - PyTorch: A leading Python library for creating machine learning models.

## Getting Started

To get started with MindReader Quantum, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend using `npm` and `pip`.

   ```bash
   # Frontend (inside the app's frontend directory)
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # Backend (inside the app's backend directory)
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your Flask backend to connect to the Hybrid Model and set up the database (if required).

4. Start the development servers:

```bash
# Frontend (inside the app's frontend directory)
npm start

# Backend (inside the app's backend directory)
python app.py
```

5. Open the Expo app on your mobile device and scan the QR code displayed by the frontend server to launch the app.
